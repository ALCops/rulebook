# VS Code

How the AL Language extension in VS Code uses your rulebook: the workspace settings, workspaces whose folder is not the app, when the editor reads the ruleset again, and how `suppressWarnings` fits in.

> **Status:** written 2026-10-10 with WP11 of the engine ([#13](https://github.com/ALCops/rulebook-engine/issues/13)). The re-read triggers were observed in the engine's [spike (e)](https://github.com/ALCops/rulebook-engine/blob/main/docs/reference/spikes/e-vscode-refetch.md) (AL extension 18.0.2819426, VS Code 1.140.0) and the settings in the WP06 live run ([rulebook-engine#60](https://github.com/ALCops/rulebook-engine/pull/60)); the setting names are Microsoft Learn's [AL Language extension configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-al-extension-configuration). The project-side facts are in [al-project.md](al-project.md).

## 1. What you need

- Your published rulebook: `<baseUrl>/` opens the index page ([getting-started.md](getting-started.md)).
- The skeletons next to `app.json`, downloaded with the init script: `.rulebook/default.ruleset.json` is the one VS Code uses ([al-project.md](al-project.md) section 3).

## 2. Workspace settings

In `.vscode/settings.json` of the workspace folder:

```json
{
  "al.ruleSetPath": ".rulebook/default.ruleset.json",
  "al.enableCodeAnalysis": true,
  "al.codeAnalyzers": ["${CodeCop}", "${UICop}", "${PerTenantExtensionCop}"],
  "al.enableExternalRulesets": true
}
```

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `al.ruleSetPath` | The `default` skeleton, relative to the workspace folder. Pointing it straight at the endpoint URL works too, but then the project has no file for its own exceptions ([al-project.md](al-project.md) section 3). |
| `al.enableCodeAnalysis` | `true`. The default is `false`: without it no analyzer runs and the ruleset changes nothing. |
| `al.codeAnalyzers` | The analyzers to run: `${CodeCop}`, `${UICop}`, `${PerTenantExtensionCop}` or `${AppSourceCop}`, and the paths of other analyzer DLLs such as ALCops. A rule of an analyzer that does not run never fires. Which of the two Microsoft cops to run: [pte-or-appsource.md](pte-or-appsource.md). |
| `al.enableExternalRulesets` | `true`, the extension's default; keep it. Set to `false`, the URL include of the skeleton fails with AL1033 and the editor falls back to the analyzer defaults (section 8). |

## 3. When the workspace folder is not the app

`al.ruleSetPath` is resolved against the **workspace folder**, which is not always the folder with `app.json`. When you open the repository root and the app is in `MyApp/`, prefix the path with the app folder:

```json
{ "al.ruleSetPath": "MyApp/.rulebook/default.ruleset.json" }
```

In a multi-root workspace (a `.code-workspace` file with one folder per app), each app folder is a workspace folder, so the plain `.rulebook/default.ruleset.json` in each app folder's own `.vscode/settings.json` should resolve per app; this layout was not tested. The init script prints paths relative to the folder it ran in ([al-project.md](al-project.md) section 4).

## 4. When VS Code reads the ruleset again

VS Code does not notice by itself that your rulebook changed, and shows no hint that it did. It reads the ruleset again on:

| Trigger | Reads again |
|---|---|
| **Developer: Reload Window** | yes |
| A change to `app.json`, saved in the editor | yes, at once |
| A saved change to `al.ruleSetPath` or `al.enableCodeAnalysis` (other `al.*` settings not tested) | yes |
| Closing and reopening the folder | yes |
| Saving an `.al` file | no |
| A change to a setting outside `al.*` | no |
| **AL: Download symbols** | no |

**The rule:** after your rulebook changes, run **Developer: Reload Window** (or save a change to `app.json`). Allow up to 10 minutes after a publish for the cache of GitHub Pages (5 minutes on `raw.githubusercontent.com`) before you reload ([hosting.md](hosting.md) section 2). After an edit to your own `.rulebook` file, reload too: whether a plain save of the local file is picked up was not tested ([al-project.md](al-project.md) section 8).

## 5. Seeing the effective rules

There is no command that prints the ruleset VS Code applies. Two ways to tell:

- **A known id.** Write code that breaks a rule your endpoint lists at another action than the analyzer default and look at the Problems pane (section 7).
- **AL1033 on `app.json`.** When the Problems pane shows AL1033 on `app.json` and every rule is at its analyzer default, the endpoint did not load: VS Code goes on with the defaults, so every `None` of your level, every lowered rule and every organization override is lost until it loads again ([al-project.md](al-project.md) section 7).

## 6. suppressWarnings

`suppressWarnings` in `app.json` switches off only the ids your endpoint does not list, Errors included; an id the endpoint lists keeps its action, without any message. For a listed id, use an exception in the `rules` of `.rulebook/default.ruleset.json` and the other stage files ([al-project.md](al-project.md) sections 5 and 6).

After you edit `suppressWarnings`, save `app.json` in the editor; if the Problems pane does not change, run **Developer: Reload Window** (a file replaced on disk by another tool sends no save to the extension).

## 7. Check that it works

1. Pick a probe from `<baseUrl>/rulesets/<level>.ruleset.json` (the `default` stage). On Strict and Complete, `AA0247` ("Use namespaces", CodeCop, default Info) is listed at `Warning`; on Essential, `AA0137` (an unused variable, default Warning) is listed at `None`.
2. Add code that breaks it: for `AA0247` a codeunit without a `namespace` line (AA0247 needs only `System.app` among the symbols); for `AA0137` a local variable that is never used.
3. Run **Developer: Reload Window**. Expect the Problems pane to show `AA0247` as a **Warning** (without the ruleset it is Information), or no `AA0137` (without the ruleset it is a Warning).

Remove the probe afterwards. Observed in the WP06 live run with `strict`: AA0247 went from Information to Warning after the reload ([rulebook-engine#60](https://github.com/ALCops/rulebook-engine/pull/60)).

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| AL1033 on `app.json`, and the rules at their default severities | The endpoint could not be loaded: the URL in the skeleton is wrong, the site is down, `al.enableExternalRulesets` is `false`, or the file is not valid JSON. | Open the include URL of `.rulebook/default.ruleset.json` in a browser; set `al.enableExternalRulesets` to `true`; check the Publish run of your rulebook. |
| A change to the rulebook does not show | The cache of the site still serves the old endpoint, or VS Code has not read the ruleset again. | Wait up to 10 minutes after the publish, then **Developer: Reload Window** (section 4). |
| An edit to `suppressWarnings` has no effect | The id is listed by the endpoint, or `app.json` was changed outside the editor. | Use an exception in `rules` for a listed id; save `app.json` in the editor or reload (section 6). |
| No analyzer diagnostics at all | `al.enableCodeAnalysis` is `false` (the default), or `al.codeAnalyzers` is empty. | Set both (section 2). |
| The ruleset seems ignored when the repository root is open | `al.ruleSetPath` is resolved against the workspace folder, not the app. | Prefix the app folder (section 3). |
| "Array has too few items. Expected 1 or more." on `"rules": []` | The extension's JSON schema for ruleset files wants at least one rule. | Harmless: the compiler accepts an empty `rules` array ([al-project.md](al-project.md) section 9). |
